<p>*WEEK 1* TEST **TEST** content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3><b>Week 1:</b> [03/10/2016-07/10/2016]</h3>

<p>Intro to Activity-Led Learning (ALL). Introduction to the group. We familiarised ourselves with the equipment provided and verified that it matched the inventory on the Equipment Loan Sheet. After introductions we began tinkering with the componenets. Skills-set analysis happened fairly organically when a sub-group accidentally spaced the wheels to far apart for the tank tread. We agreed to model out robot after TRACK3R for it's simplicity.
        
Eventually we contructed a bed to mount the Programmable Brick onto. Two large motors were attatched to the wheel axles eitherside. After that we familiarised ourselves with the Lego visual programming language and were able to get the brick to run some very basic programmes.</p>
